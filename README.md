# Title : 8 - Bit ALU ( Arithmetic Logic Unit ) Verification using System Verilog.
# 1) Introduction:
      The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is an important part of digital systems that performs math and logic operations.
      This project designs an **8-bit ALU** in **Verilog HDL** that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logic, and shift operations.
      It takes two 8-bit inputs (`a`, `b`), a 4-bit control signal (`sel`) to choose the operation, and an enable signal (`en`).
      The result is a 16-bit output (`out`).
      This project helps understand **combinational logic** and **Verilog programming**, and can be simulated using tools like **ModelSim** or **Vivado**.
